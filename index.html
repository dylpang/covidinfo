            As the pandemic lingers, the term “deferred care” caught fire in health care circles—referring to the fact that many would avoid a doctor’s office or hospital for any procedure that could wait. But a Gallup poll finds a darker side to this phenomenon: 1 in 7 Americans report they would not seek care for a fever or dry cough—the classic symptoms of COVID-19. The reason? Cost concerns. Those most likely to avoid medical treatment for symptoms are younger than age 30 and make less than $40,000 a year. By the end of April, 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment since mid-March.

              In a White House briefing yesterday, Anthony Fauci, MD, underscored growing concern over the COVID-19 delta variant, according to Forbes, which has grown in prevalence from 9.9% of new cases just 2 weeks ago to 20% this week in the United States. The expanding threat from delta, which Fauci now calls “the greatest threat in the US in our attempt to eliminate COVID-19,” also now accounts for more than 90% of new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom. This news comes as the White House announced that President Biden’s goal of 70% of adults having at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine dose by July 4 will not be met.

              On 26 November 2021, WHO designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern, named Omicron. The CDC has been actively monitoring and preparing for this variant, and they will continue to work diligently with other U.S. and global public health and industry partners to learn more. Despite the detection of Omicron, Delta remains the predominant strain in the United States.
